My name is Lucien JACQUES.

I am a first-year master's student in CSMI at the University of Strasbourg.

My appetite for mathematics led me to choose a preparatory class in mathematics and physics after my baccalaureate.
I was able to deepen my knowledge of fundamental mathematics and at the same time be introduced to computer science using Python and SQL.
After these two years, I enrolled in an industrial engineering programme. This allowed me to take a more practical approach to the concepts I had learned by carrying out programming projects and various internships.
Today, I am focused on applied mathematics and computer science. I have been able to enrich my skills in various programming languages such as C and C++.
